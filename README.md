# Baabedo Ruby bindings

Ruby bindings for the Baabedo API

**still under construction**

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'baabedo'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install baabedo

## Usage

Simple usage:

```
Baabedo.access_token = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxx'

Baabedo::Channel.all # list all channels
```

Advanced usage if you need to handle different access_tokens

```
client = Baabedo::Client.new
client.access_token = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxx'

# the access_token and any other configuration made on the client will only be used inside this block
client.use do
  Baabedo::Channel.all
end

```
